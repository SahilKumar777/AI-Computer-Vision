# AI-Computer Vision
This repo contains my "Computer Vision &amp; AI" related projects.

### Hands Landmarks Detection
This project capture the video using webcam and then performs hands detection and hands key points detection. It finally provides the recognition video of hand landmarks of the detected hands.

### Hands Gesture Detection
This project performs hands guesture recognition in real time on a pretrained model. The output can be used to recognize specific hand gestures from a user, and invoke application features that correspond to those gestures.

### Face Detection
This project performs face detection in real time using mediapipe framework. The output can be used to detect human faces and count number of human faces in the frame, and it can be used in various applications.
